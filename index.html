<!--<p>KitKit was a great ferret. Here are some pictures of her.</p> I think this part is sad, 
and until I can think of a way to rewrite it better I think I will leave it as a comment. -->

<!--One day, me and Dad visited Earl May in Norfolk. I saw a very interesting creature there, a ferret. I couldn't stop thinking of them when we got home, and 
my parents agreed to buy me a ferret. I wanted to buy the ferret I had seen the first time when we went back, but it was gone. We came back a few weeks later,
in the afternoon, and saw three ferrets for sale. I looked them all over, and very quickly picked the biggest, and snuggliest, one. We bought her, and she was
sealed in a box for the car ride home, and was trying to escape the whole time. When we were almost home, we discussed possible names for the new ferret. Mom 
and Hannah wanted to name her Rosie, but I had learned that baby ferrets were called kits, so I decided to name her KitKit, short for Kitrina. We set up her cage,
and played with her. We had many fun times over the years.
