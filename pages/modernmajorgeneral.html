<div class="original">
I am the very model of a modern Major-General,
I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical,
From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;
I'm very well acquainted too with matters mathematical,
I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,
About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news---
With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.

I'm very good at integral and differential calculus,
I know the scientific names of beings animalculous;
In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I am the very model of a modern Major-General.

I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's,
I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,
I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,
In conics I can floor peculiarities parablous.
I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,
I know the croaking chorus from the Frogs of Aristophanes,
Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,
And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.

Then I can write a washing bill in Balylonic cuneiform,
And tell you every detail of Caractacus's uniform;
In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I am the very model of a modern Major-General.

In fact, when I know what is meant by "mamelon" and "ravelin",
When I can tell at sight a chassepôt rifle from a javelin,
When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at,
And when I know precisely what is meant by "commissariat",
When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery,
When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery:
In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy,
You'll say a better Major-General has never sat a gee---

For my military knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventury,
Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century;
But still in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,
I am the very model of a modern Major-General.

    I'm not a model of a modern Major-General

We are the king of England and History

I'm very familiar with math problems

The truth is, a lot of joy to the gut:

I'm very well, and it was a component of the article
Animalculous:
In the words of issues, vegetable, animal and mineral other,
I'm not the latest model:

You know the legend of Arthur and Sir see messages

I know that the team whisper Aristophanes and Jabin
Religious music is heard the noise of Fogo
It exploded in what's Stories:

I'm just so you can say, Caractacus.
In the words of issues, vegetable, animal and mineral other,
I'm not the latest model:

In other words, there is an element of strategy
--- General Samuel could be better,

My field of military training, and I was upset and I think that this adventure
At the beginning of the century:
But still, vegetable, animal and mineral issues
I'm not the latest model:
  </div>
  <p> You can see that the major general has lost a lot a confidence! "I'm not the latest model", "--- General Samuel could be better"
    I wonder why these languages make him much more humble? </p>
